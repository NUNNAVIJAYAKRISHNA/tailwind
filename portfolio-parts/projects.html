            struggle with effective event management and publicity, as traditional methods like manual
            announcements and scattered social media updates lead to poor student awareness and low participation.
            To address this issue, we propose CampusConnect—a centralized web platform that streamlines
            communication and enhances student engagement within AITAM College. The platform aims to serve as a
            one-stop solution for students to stay informed about upcoming events, receive instant updates, and
            actively participate. For organizers, it reduces workload by simplifying outreach and improving
            overall attendance. By bridging communication gaps, CampusConnect aims to create a more connected and
            interactive campus culture.

            As noted by the Innovation Cell, AITAM, it is difficult to get a in-class maintenance issue solved as soon as
            possible. Had the previlige to work on a project that bridges the gap between students and maintenance staff
            where students can directly complain about the existing nuances regarding infrastructure to the concerned
            authorities, on which they can get regular updates on.
            This greatly assits the procedure of getting a problem fixed. Where there would be a log formal list of things
            need to be done to achieve such a task, our website makes it in a flash.
